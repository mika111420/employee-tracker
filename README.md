# Employee Tracker

##Description
This weeks challenge was to build a command line application to manage a company's employee data using a command line Content Management System (CMS) built with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The application is designed to efficiently manage employee data, allowing users to interact with the system through a command line interface. This application has the ability to:
-View All Employees
-Add Employees
-Update Employee Role
-View All Roles
-Add Role
-View All Departments
-Add Departments


##Installation 
* Check if you have Node.js installed by typing "node -v" in your command line. If node is not installed, visit the Node.js website to install.
* Next, clone the project repository to the local machine.
* Use the command "npm install" to install dependencies.
* Create a file in the root directory titled ".env" and type "PASSWORD='[YOUR PASSWORD HERE]'"
* Type "MySQL -u root -p" in the terminal and enter your personal MySQL password. This connects the database to the data.

##Usage
*Open in the root terminal, and type "node index.js"
*Select a given task and follow the Inquirer prompts.
